# Step 10: Auto refresh

- Sometimes an action needs to be carried out as part of the stream, for example to persist a value to `localStorage`
- With **RxJS**, this is achieved using the `tap` operator
- When this is included as part of the observable `pipe`, the supplied function is ran, its return value is discarded and the value is passed along unchanged to any downstream operators or subscribers

  obs[Observable stream]
  opTransform[Transforming operator, e.g. map]
  opTap[Tap operator]
  downstream[Downstream operators and subscribers]
  sideEffect((Fire and forget side effect))
    obs --> opTransform -- value is transformed --> opTap -- value passed along unchanged --> downstream
    opTap --> sideEffect

# Step 10: Exercise ðŸ’»

<div class="dense">

- Create a `Subject` property in the movie service to be used to indicate when the watch list is updated (typed as `void`) 
- Combine this with stream in the watch list query (taking care not to block the stream)
- After posting to the watch list in the service, trigger the watchlist updated subject
- As a bonus, update the movie summary card to show a "Remove from watchlist" button that removes the movie from the users watch list
- ðŸ’¡For this you will need to use another `*ngIf` attribute in the template or an `else` block as part of the existing `*ngIf` attribute
- ðŸ’¡You will need to add another output to the movie summary card component to emit the remove event to be handled in the movie list component
