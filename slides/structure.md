# Workshop structure

<div class="dense">

- This workshop is made up of multiple, incremental steps
- It's built using [Nx](https://nx.dev), an open source build system inspired by the Angular CLI
- At each step you are asked to add features and solve problems
- The `src/start-here` folder is where you should write your code
- The `src/solutions` folder contains the solutions to the challenges
- The ðŸ’¡ icon indicates hints
- As there is a focus on leveraging **RxJS** to it's fullest, a warmup step is included to gently introduce or re-acquaint you with the library
- Feel free to skip this if you are already proficient in it
