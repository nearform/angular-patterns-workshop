- **Angular** templates allow **conditional rendering** parts of it by using the `ngIf` directive primarily with the shorthand syntax `*ngIf="condition"`
- Another familiar programming concept, **for loops**, are implemented in **Angular** templates as the `ngFor` directive and can be used with the shorthand syntax `*ngFor="let movie of movies"` 
- Simple values in templates can be **interpolated** using the double curly brackets, e.g. `{{movie.description}}`
- Another useful concept available in templates is **pipes**, which similar to piping data on the commandline allow transforming values via one or more pipes, e.g. `{{ birthday | date | uppercase}}`
- When working with observable streams a particularly useful pipe is the `async` pipe which not only transforms the latest value of the stream into a value that can be used in the template but also automatically unsubscribes to the stream when the component is destroyed
