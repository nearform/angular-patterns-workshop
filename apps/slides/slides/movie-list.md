# Step 4: Output a list of movies

<div class="dense">

- **Angular** templates allow **conditional rendering** parts of it by using the `ngIf` directive primarily with the shorthand syntax `*ngIf="condition"`
- Another familiar programming concept, **for loops**, are implemented in **Angular** templates as the `ngFor` directive and can be used with the shorthand syntax `*ngFor="let movie of movies"`
- Simple values in templates can be **interpolated** using double curly brackets, e.g. `{{movie.description}}`
- Another useful concept available in templates is **pipes**, which similar to piping data on the commandline allow transforming values via one or more pipes, e.g. `{{ birthday | date | uppercase}}`
- When working with observable streams a particularly useful pipe is the `async` pipe which not only transforms the latest value of the stream into a value that can be used in the template but also automatically unsubscribes to the stream when the component is destroyed

# Step 4: Exercise ðŸ’»

<div class="dense">

- Render a list of popular movies based on the response from **tmdb** which you have prepared in previous steps
- Include both the **title** and **overview** fields in the rendered output
- You will need to use `*ngIf` to ensure the movies stream is ready along with the `async` pipe to prepare the movies list for use in the template
- `*ngFor` will be required to loop through each of the movies in the list
- Finally, you will need to use interpolation syntax (`{{item.value}}`) to render the values from each of the movies
- ðŸ’¡ Consider using [material card](https://material.angular.io/components/card/overview) to improve the visual appearance of the list (which is installed and ready to use)
- ðŸ’¡ To add a little space in the list try adding the `stack` class to the list container
