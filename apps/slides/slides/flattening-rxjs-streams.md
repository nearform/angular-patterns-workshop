# Step 8: Flattening RxJS streams

<div class="dense">

- A common situation when working with **RxJS** is triggering streams based on another stream
- A good example of this a stream of clicks from a button which calling an API that returns an Observable stream
- The naive and intuitive approach would lead to heavy nesting and difficult to understand code:

```typescript
// Don't do this!!!
this.returnsObservable().subscribe((success) => {
  this.returnsObservable2().subscribe((success) => {
    this.returnsObservable3().subscribe((success) => {});
  });
});
```

# Step 8: RxJS flattening operators

<div class="dense">

- To prevent nesting and make usage more ergonomic, **RxJS** lets you apply a number of strategies to flattening streams
- This is at the core of how asynchronous behaviours are defined in the library
- **RxJS** supplies a number of flattening operators including `mergeMap`, `concatMap`, `exhaustMap` and `switchMap` which take the current value of the primary stream and return an **inner** stream
- For instance the behaviour of `concatMap` is to queue up all emissions from the primary stream one by one to execute the function supplied:

```typescript
// An Observable stream of paths
const paths$ = of('/call-me-first', '/then-call-me');
// Map value from source into inner Observable, when complete emit result and move to next
const getResults$ = source.pipe(concatMap((path) => this.http.get(path)));

getResults$.subscribe((response) => {
  // Will sequentially log the responses from the different paths
  console.log(response);
});
```

</div>

# Step 8: switchMap

<div class="dense">

- In day-to-day usage, a particularly useful flattening operator is `switchMap` which, on receiving a new value from the primary stream, immediately cancels the current inner stream and creates a new inner stream based on this latest value
- In the case of an API call, it ensures that:
  - Only one call is being made to the backend
  - This is based on the latest value
  - Requests based on the old value are cancelled

# Step 8: Exercise

<div class="dense">

- Add a new `Subject` property to the movie list component that takes a `number` as its generic parameter
- Trigger this stream when the "Add to watchlist" event occurs in the movie summary card, passing in the movie id to the `next` method
- On component initialization subscribe to this stream and use a suitable **RxJs** operator to call the watchlist endpoint to add the movie to the users watchlist
- In flight requests should be cancelled when a new "Add to watchlist" click is received
- Similar to the previous **unsubscribe** challenge ensure that any in flight requests are cancelled on navigating away from the page

# Step 8: Trying it out

<div class="dense">
 
- Use your browser developer tools to slow down network request by setting **throttling** to "Slow 3G" or similar 
- Click repeatedly on the "Add to watchlist" button on a few different movies
- Notice that only the last request is sent to the server and other in flight requests are cancelled
- ðŸ’¡ This technique can be used to improve common UX issues, for example implementing an autocomplete search box
