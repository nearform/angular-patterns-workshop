# Step 0: Observables

- An **Observable** can be compared to a simple JavaScript function
- Like a function they are lazy and won't do anything until they are invoked
- Unlike functions however, they allow outputting multiple values over time
- Similarly to a function call for functions, an Observable stream is "activated" when you **subscribe** to the stream
- Up to that point it can be thought of as a blueprint for the behaviour and transformation of the Observable

```typescript
// Does nothing
const myObservable$ = of(1, 2, 3, 4);
// Still does nothing, simply describes the transformation of the stream by multiplying each value by 10
const myObservable2$ = myObservable$.pipe(map((x) => x * 10));

// Now the observable is actually ran
myObservable2$.subscribe((nextValue) => console.log(nextValue));
```

# Step 0: Creating and transforming Observables

- While you will most commonly work with Observables that are returned from services such as the Angular **HttpClient**, simple Observables can be created using the [`of`](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/of) creation operator provided by **RxJS**
- `const myObs$ = of(1, 2, 3, 4)` creates an Observable that will emit each of the numbers in sequence when you subscribe to the stream
- Observables can be chained with a call to its [`pipe`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/operators#piping) method which accepts single or multiple **operators** to transform the stream
- For instance when the **RxJS** [`map`](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/map) function is supplied as an argument to `pipe`, it works similarly to the standard JavaScript array `map` method, but transforms each value as it is received over time rather than immediately iterating over all elements
- More complex higher order operators such as [`mergeMap`](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/mergeMap), [`switchMap`](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/switchMap) and [`concatMap`](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/concatMap) allow combining streams and dynamically altering the stream topology (these will be touched on later in the workshop)

# Step 0: Exercise ðŸ’»

- In the `start-here.component.ts` file, create an Observable using **RxJS** `of` with a series of integers (e.g. `const myObs$ = of(1000, 2000)`)
- ðŸ’¡ The various operators should be imported from the **RxJS** library as follows `import { map, delay } from 'rxjs'`
- Subscribe to the Observable using its `subscribe` method, passing in a callback function which logs the stream values (e.g. `myObs$.subscribe(value => console.log(value))`)
- Chain a `.pipe` to this and experiment with different **RxJS** operators to transform this value, e.g. `map`, `delay`
- Try passing in a higher order operator like `concatMap` to really alter the behaviour of the stream:

```typescript
// Will delay each by the value in the stream
myObs$.pipe(concatMap((val) => of(`Delayed by: ${val}ms`).pipe(delay(val))));
// (No need to fully understand this for now)
```

# Step 0: Trying it out

- Observe the behaviour of the stream in your browsers console as you update the code
- Pay particular attention to the fact that the Observable is completely inert until you subscribe to the stream
- ðŸ’¡ You can remove this code before continuing to the next step
