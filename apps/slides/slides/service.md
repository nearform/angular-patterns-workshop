# Step 2: Angular services

<div class="dense">

- An Angular service is a TypeScript class that can be used to share business or data access logic across an application
- Services can be marked as injectable using the `@Injectable` decorator
- Setting `providedIn` to `root`, ensures that Angular creates a single, shared instance and injects it into any class requesting the service

```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
class MovieService {}
```

- A common naming convention in Angular is to include `.service` before the file extension, e.g. `movie.service.ts`

# Step 2: Exercise ðŸ’»

- Create an Angular service (in the `start-here` directory) to retrieve **popular movies** from the [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) (TMDB)
- You will need to create a TMDB account and add your **API Key (v3 auth)** to `src/environments/environment.development.ts`:

```typescript
apiKey: '<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>';
```

- Angular provides a stream based `HttpClient` for making HTTP requests
- This tutorial provides an `ApiService` that wraps the `HttpClient` and adds authentication headers
- Inject the `ApiService` into your service constructor and use it to make an HTTP GET request to `movies/popular`
- ðŸ’¡ See the [TMDB API Documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-popular-movies) for details on the response shape
- Your service method will return a stream to which components and templates can subscribe
- Use the `pipe` and `map` operators to map the stream values into collection of movie `id`, `title`, and `overview`

# Step 2: Trying it out

- Inject your service into your Hello World component via the constructor
- To test your service response, you can subscribe to your _get popular movies_ method from the component and `console.log` any values from the stream
- ðŸ’¡ You can implement the `OnInit` interface and subscribe to the stream within the component's `ngOnInit` lifecycle event
