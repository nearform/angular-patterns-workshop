- This workshop is made of multiple, incremental steps
- It's built using of [Nx](https://nx.dev), a build system that works very well with Angular
- At each step you are asked to add features and solve problems
- The `src/challenges` folder is where you should write your code
- The `src/solutions` folder contains the solutions to the challenges
- The 💡 icon indicates hints

</div>

# Let's get started! 🚀

</div>

---

# Step 0: Useful rxjs hints and tips 

Provide a comprehensive list of rx snippets that will be needed throughout the code to avoid blocking participants.

---

# Step 1: Write an Angular component

Will provide the command line generate function: `nx g @nrwl/angular:component my-component`

---

# Step 2: Write an Angular service that calls a backend API

Will call TMDB popular movies endpoint with Angular http

---

# Step 3: Subscribe to the service you created in the previous step

Will just get dev to console log the result in the component

---

# Step 4: Output a list of movies

Perhaps suggesting using some Material Ui components to make it look a little nicer

---

# Step 5: Add auto unsubscription by using Angular `async` pipe

---

# Step 6: Add a poster image

---

# Step 7: Improve the performance of the image by using ng optimized image

---

# Step 8: Create an action in Angular

Rate a movie

---

# Step 9: Calling this action from the component

Call this service from an Angular component

---

# Step 10: Unsubscribe from an observable when a component is destroyed
